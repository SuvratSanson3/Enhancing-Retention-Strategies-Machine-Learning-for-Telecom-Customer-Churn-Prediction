# Enhancing Retention Strategies: Machine Learning for Telecom Customer Churn Prediction
In the highly competitive telecommunications industry, retaining existing customers is as critical as acquiring new ones. Customer churn, the phenomenon where customers discontinue using a service, can significantly impact a companyâ€™s revenue and growth. For telecom providers, understanding and predicting customer churn is essential to developing targeted retention strategies and improving customer satisfaction.

In this project, we aim to develop a predictive model that identifies customers likely to churn based on historical data. The dataset includes various attributes related to customer demographics, account information, usage behavior, and service subscription details. Specifically, features include customer demographic attributes (such as gender, SeniorCitizen status, Partner, Dependents), service usage patterns (tenure, PhoneService, InternetService type, MonthlyCharges), and customer engagement indicators (OnlineSecurity, TechSupport, Contract type). The target variable, Churn, indicates whether a customer has discontinued the service (Yes) or remains active (No).

The primary objective of this project is to accurately predict customer churn using machine learning algorithms. With a well-performing model, telecom companies can identify high-risk customers, allowing for timely interventions like customized offers, improved customer support, or other retention strategies. This predictive approach is expected to reduce churn rates and contribute to customer lifetime value.
